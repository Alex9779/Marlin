This is the RepRapPRo version of Marlin.

Modifications mainly be Jean-Marc and Adrian

The core Marlin code in the Marlin directory is stable and is our standard
release firmware for all RepRapPro RepRap machines.

Code in the Slave directory is under development.  This drives a slave
controller (with the core Marling code on the master controller) to control
multiple extruders.
